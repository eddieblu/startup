# Sunshine Gratitude

[My Notes](notes.md)

**Sunshine Gratitude** is a daily reflection platform inspired by the beloved hymn “There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today,” encouraging short (up to 150 characters), uplifting gratitude posts in a warm, faith-centered atmosphere. Each new post unlocks a real-time community feed with instant heart reactions, while a sun icon tracks your streak. Entries automatically expire at day’s end for a fresh start every morning, and an admin-only dashboard ensures simple, secure user management.

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.


## 🚀 Specification Deliverable
For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

### Elevator pitch

Sunshine Gratitude is an innovative twist on daily gratitude, blending spiritual well-being into a faith-based social network. One post each day unlocks a feed of uplifting entries, sparking real-time encouragement through heart-reacts and streak-driven consistency. Whether you’re looking to cultivate a deeper spiritual routine or find uplifting support from a like-minded community, Sunshine Gratitude is here to guide you toward a brighter, more meaningful life—one day at a time.

### Design

![Design image](placeholder.png)

The following are two separate sequence diagrams to explain the core flows. This first diagram depicts the registration and login process as well as what results from a bad log in and an admin log in. 

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as Browser (React)
    participant S as Server
    participant DB as Database

    U->>B: Request Register Page
    B->>S: GET /
    S->>B: Return HTML/CSS/JS

    U->>B: 

    alt Login Successful
        S->>B: Return Auth Token
    else Login Failed
        S->>B: Return Error 
    end
```

This next diagram depicts the core flows of a normal user who will post and interact with the community posts. 

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as Browser (React)
    participant S as Server
    participant DB as Database

    U->>B: Request Gratitude Feed Page
    B->>S: GET /feed
    S->>B: Return HTML/CSS/JS

    U->>B: Enter Daily Gratitude (<150 chars)
    B->>S: POST /api/gratitude
    S->>DB: Store New Post
    DB->>S: Acknowledgment
    S->>B: Return Success (Post Visible)

    B->>S: Subscribe to Feed (WebSocket)
    S->>B: Broadcast Real-Time Feed

    U->>B: Click "Heart" on a Post
    B->>S: (WebSocket) Send "heart" action
    S->>B: Broadcast Updated Heart Count

    U->>B: Choose to "Save" Post to Archive
    B->>S: POST /api/archive
    S->>DB: Update Post to Mark as Saved
    DB->>S: Acknowledgment
    S->>B: Return Success (Post Saved)
```

- Automatic expiry of daily entries
- Admin dashboard for password resets

  
### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for the application. Two HTML pages (a login page and a gratitude feed page).
- **CSS** - Establishes consistent styling across different screen sizes. Uses good whitespace, colour choice, and contrast.  
- **React** - Provides registration, login, daily gratitude posting (<150 chars), and showing others’ posts in real-time. A separate admin page or route allows only admins to reset other users’ passwords.  
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - **/api/registration** (user registration)    
  - **/api/login** (user authentication)  
  - **/api/gratitude** (submitting and retrieving gratitude posts)  
  - **/api/heart** (real-time reactions)  
  - **/api/admin/reset** (admin-only password reset)  
- **DB/Login** - Stores user credentials, daily gratitude posts, and heart-react data. Includes secure password hashing. Users must be authenticated to post or react. Only admins can perform password resets. 
- **WebSocket** - Broadcasts new posts and heart-reacts instantly to all connected clients for real-time feed updates.
