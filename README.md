# Sunshine Gratitude

[My Notes](notes.md)

**Sunshine Gratitude** is a daily reflection platform inspired by the beloved hymn ‚ÄúThere Is Sunshine in My Soul Today,‚Äù encouraging short, uplifting gratitude posts in a warm, faith-centered atmosphere. Each new post unlocks a real-time community feed with instant heart reactions, while a sun icon tracks your streak. Entries automatically expire at day‚Äôs end for a fresh start every morning, and an admin-only dashboard ensures simple, secure user management.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for the application. Two HTML pages (a login page and a gratitude feed page).
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes. Uses good whitespace, colour choice and contrast. 
- **React** - Provides registration, login, daily posting, feed display, and real-time post reactions. A separate admin route allows only admins to reset other users‚Äô passwords.  
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - **/api/registration** (user registration)    
  - **/api/login** (user authentication)  
  - **/api/gratitude** (submitting and retrieving gratitude posts)  
  - **/api/heart** (real-time reactions)  
  - **/api/admin/reset** (admin-only password reset)  
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, gratitude posts, and heart-react data in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database (password hashing). Users must be authenticated to post, view posts or react. Posts older than one day are automatically removed. 
- **WebSocket** - Broadcasts new posts and heart-reacts instantly to all connected clients for real-time feed updates.
