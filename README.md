# Sunshine Gratitude

[My Notes](notes.md)

**Sunshine Gratitude** is a daily reflection platform inspired by the beloved hymn “There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today,” encouraging short (up to 150 characters), uplifting gratitude posts in a warm, faith-centered atmosphere. Each new post unlocks a real-time community feed with instant heart reactions, while a sun icon tracks your streak. Entries automatically expire at day’s end for a fresh start every morning, and an admin-only dashboard ensures simple, secure user management.

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for the application. Two HTML pages (a login page and a gratitude feed page).
- **CSS** - Establishes consistent styling across different screen sizes. Uses good whitespace, colour choice, and contrast.  
- **React** - Provides registration, login, daily posting, showing the feed, and reacting to others’ posts in real-time. A separate admin route allows only admins to reset other users’ passwords.  
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - **/api/registration** (user registration)    
  - **/api/login** (user authentication)  
  - **/api/gratitude** (submitting and retrieving gratitude posts)  
  - **/api/heart** (real-time reactions)  
  - **/api/admin/reset** (admin-only password reset)  
- **DB/Login** - Stores user credentials, daily gratitude posts, and heart-react data. Includes secure password hashing. Users must be authenticated to post or react. Automatically removes posts older than one day 
- **WebSocket** - Broadcasts new posts and heart-reacts instantly to all connected clients for real-time feed updates.
